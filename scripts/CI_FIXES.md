# CI Pipeline Fixes for namegnome

## Summary of Issues

After analyzing the CI pipeline failures, we identified several issues that were causing the build to fail consistently:

1. **Platform-specific path handling issues**: Tests were failing on Windows due to path format incompatibilities
2. **Symlink handling in Windows CI environments**: File operations that worked locally were failing in GitHub Actions
3. **Inconsistent environment variable handling**: HOME vs USERPROFILE on different platforms
4. **Pre-commit and pre-push hook inconsistencies**: The pre-commit config and ci_checks.sh script had different behavior
5. **Dependency management gaps**: Some dependencies needed for tests were missing

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ci_checks.sh Script

- Added better platform detection for Windows-specific fixes
- Improved error handling by capturing exit codes instead of using `|| true`
- Enhanced the dependency checking to include all required test dependencies
- Added pre-commit installation check
- Added Windows-specific handling for running pre-commit
- Improved exit code handling for more accurate failure reporting
- Set PYTHONIOENCODING for consistent text handling on Windows

### 2. Created debug_windows_tests.sh Script

- Created a dedicated debugging tool to help identify Windows-specific issues
- Added path handling diagnostics to report how paths are being handled
- Added symlink capability testing to identify permission issues
- Focused tests on problematic modules for more targeted debugging

### 3. Fixed plan_store.py Module

- Simplified symlink logic to always use file copy on Windows or in CI
- Used os.path.join for better cross-platform path construction
- Improved error handling and logging for file operations
- Removed ambiguous symlink capability detection

### 4. Updated test_plan_store.py Tests

- Used correct environment variables (HOME/USERPROFILE) based on platform
- Added more robust skipping of tests that can't work in CI environments
- Added fallback copy mechanism when symlinks fail
- Made test assertions more compatible with platform differences
- Improved test resilience by comparing content instead of IDs when appropriate

### 5. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

- Added explicit bash shell specification for Windows runs
- Added a debug step specifically for Windows environment diagnostics
- Ensured consistent PYTHONPATH configuration
- Set CI=true environment variable explicitly
- Added better error handling for debugging actions

## Results

These changes should address the CI failures by:

1. **Making file operations cross-platform compatible**
2. **Improving test reliability in CI environments**
3. **Removing dependency on symlink functionality on Windows**
4. **Ensuring consistent behavior between pre-commit hooks and CI checks**
5. **Capturing and reporting errors more accurately**

## Future Recommendations

1. **Use Path objects consistently**: Always use `pathlib.Path` for path manipulation instead of string concatenation
2. **Test cross-platform behavior locally**: When adding new file operations, test Windows behavior
3. **Avoid symlinks in core functionality**: Use file copies as a more reliable alternative
4. **Keep CI and pre-commit in sync**: When updating one, always update the other
5. **Consider adding platform-specific CI jobs**: Add specific test jobs that only run on certain platforms

## Testing These Changes

To test these changes locally, you can:

1. Run the new debug script: `bash scripts/debug_windows_tests.sh`
2. Run the updated CI checks: `bash scripts/ci_checks.sh`
3. Clone the repo on a Windows machine to verify cross-platform compatibility
