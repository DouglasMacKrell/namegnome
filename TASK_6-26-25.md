## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Policy

All work defined in this document **must** follow TDD:

* **Write or update a failing test before fixing/adding code.**
* **Only write the minimum code to make the test pass.**
* **Refactor with tests green.**
* **Document test coverage and rationale for each ticket.**
* **No ticket is complete until all acceptance criteria are met and tests pass.**

---

## 1 · Sprint 0 (Baseline & CLI Polish)

Purpose: establish a solid CLI UX foundation and ensure every flag/option is discoverable and covered by tests.

### 0.1 CLI Help & Flag Audit
* **Goal:** `namegnome --help` and every sub-command list accurate, concise help entries.
* **Tests to Write:** snapshot tests of `--help` output for root, `scan`, `apply`, `undo`.
* **Steps:**
  1. Run each command, capture help, compare to expected in test fixtures.
  2. Fix missing or misleading descriptions, group flags logically.
* **Done when:** all snapshot tests pass on all OS runners.

### 0.2 Rich Progress & Error Surfaces
* **Goal:** Replace raw `print` statements with Rich spinners/progress and pretty-traceback.
* **Tests to Write:** console output tests using `rich.console.CaptureError` (or similar) verifying spinner start/stop and traceback formatting stub.
* **Steps:**
  1. Create `src/namegnome/cli/console.py` with a `ConsoleManager` context-manager that installs Rich pretty-traceback and yields a configured `Console`.
  2. Replace direct `print` and `traceback.print_exc()` calls in CLI entry-points and long-running loops with `console.print` or `console.status`.
  3. Wrap file/dir iteration loops in `rich.progress.Progress` using `SpinnerColumn` plus a custom `FilenameColumn` to show current path.
  4. Add `--no-rich` flag and `NAMEGNOME_NO_RICH` env-var; when set, fall back to plain output.
  5. Capture output in tests with `rich.console.Console.capture` and assert spinner lifecycle & coloured traceback.
  6. Update README with a before/after GIF.
* **Done when:** scan on a sample dir shows spinner; exception renders coloured traceback; tests green.

### 0.3 Shell Autocompletion
* **Goal:** Generate bash/zsh/fish completion scripts via Typer autopilot.
* **Tests to Write:** call `namegnome --show-completion bash` and assert no error / expected snippet header.
* **Steps:**
  1. Add Typer command `namegnome completion [shell]` that prints the completion script via `get_completion_script()`.
  2. Implement `namegnome init` to write the script to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/namegnome/completions` and append a `source` line to the user's shell RC file (idempotent).
  3. In CI, run the command for each supported shell and grep for the function header to ensure validity.
  4. Document manual install snippet for each shell in README.
* **Done when:** script generation works and documented.

### 0.4 Config & Env-Var Parity
* **Goal:** every CLI flag has an env-var + config-file equivalent with deterministic precedence (CLI > env > TOML config > default).
* **Tests to Write:** parametrised matrix asserting a given flag value overrides env & config; use tmp TOML file per test.
* **Steps:**
  1. Implement `utils.config.resolve_setting(key, default)` walking precedence chain.
  2. Default config file lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/namegnome/config.toml` (fallback `~/.config/namegnome/config.toml`).
  3. Add command `namegnome config docs` to render a Rich table of settings → env-var → default.
  4. Provide negative-case tests (missing key, invalid type) and precedence tests covering CLI vs ENV vs TOML.
* **Done when:** all precedence tests pass.

### 0.5 CLI Visual Rebuild
* **Goal:** Restore banner, status-gnome panels, richer progress bar, and framed summary as in `DEMO.md` screenshots.
* **Tests to Write:**
  * `tests/cli/test_visuals.py` — snapshot banner & gnome output (ANSI-stripped).
  * Param test for each gnome type produces expected emoji/message.
  * Progress bar test uses custom `FilenameColumn` to show percent · elapsed · filename.
* **Steps:**
  1. Call `print_title(console)` at start of `scan`, `apply`, `undo` (skip when `--no-color`).
  2. Add `cli/console.py` context-manager `gnome_status()`; wrap major phases (`scanning`, `planning`, `moving`, `rollback`).
  3. Implement custom Rich `FilenameColumn` & inject into all `Progress` instances.
  4. On success show `print_gnome_status("happy")`; on error show `print_gnome_status("error")`.
  5. Update `DEMO.md` with new screenshots.
* **Done when:**
  * All new tests pass; existing renderer tests unaffected.
  * Running `namegnome scan` shows banner → "Working" gnome → progress → diff → "Happy" gnome.
  * CI green on macOS/Linux/Windows.

### 0.6 Documentation Sweep
* **Goal:** Make sure that all documentation is robust and complete.
* **Steps:**)
  1. Review [README](README.md) for:
    A. Duplicate information.
    B. Incorrect legacy information (including flowcharts and diagrams).
    C. Incomplete or missing information or context.
    D. Formatting errors.
    E. Structure/flow inconsistency (make sure sections are grouped correctly and in an understandable progression).
  2. Review [/docs/](/docs/).
    A. Specifics:
      1. Delete KNOWN_ISSUES.md (this will be restored later when we've made more progress).
      2. Overhaul quickstart.md to be a better aid to first time users (this we'll retain for now, but we'll need to keep this current as we continue to add functionality).
      3. Does the project still have progress logging tools? If so, update progress-logging.md. Otherwise, delete progress-logging.md
* **Done when:** docs are polished and present the current state of the project.

## 2 · Sprint 1 (TV Scan Completion)

Purpose: finish outstanding TV scan logic and lock regression suite.

### 1.1 Episode-List Normalisation (RECOVERY 0.3.1)
* **Goal:** `normalize_episode_list` returns list[dict] with `season`/`episode` **int** fields; skips invalid rows.
* **Tests to Update:**
  * `tests/core/test_planner.py::TestTVPlannerHelpers::test_normalize_episode_list`
  * `tests/core/test_planner.py::test_normalize_episode_list`
* **Steps:**
  1. Accept input list[dict] from providers with keys `season`, `episode`, `title` (str/int).
  2. Coerce zero-padded strings via `int(value.lstrip('0') or 0)`.
  3. Skip rows if either field missing, non-numeric or < 0.
  4. Edge-case tests: `S00E00` (skip), `S1E05a` (skip).
* **Done when:** both tests pass with no regressions elsewhere.

### 1.2 Plan Orchestration Core Functions (RECOVERY 0.5)
* **Goal:** Implement `fetch_episode_list`, `_add_plan_item_and_callback`, `_handle_unsupported_media_type`, `_anthology_split_segments`.
* **Tests to Write:** failing unit tests in `tests/core/tv/test_plan_orchestration*.py` for each function.
* **Steps:**
  1. Define call order in `tv/plan_orchestration.py::build_plan()`:
     a. `fetch_episode_list()`
     b. `_anthology_split_segments()` when `--anthology` enabled.
     c. `_add_plan_item_and_callback()` per segment.
     d. `_handle_unsupported_media_type()` fallback.
  2. Callback must accept `(PlanItem, Console)` and may update progress.
  3. Raise `UnsupportedMediaError` for unsupported inputs; CLI converts to friendly message.
* **Done when:** all orchestration tests green.

### 1.3 Provider Fallback & Cache Invalidation
* **Goal:** if primary TV provider fails, fallback to secondary; invalidate stale cache.
* **Tests to Write:** mock provider 1 500s → provider 2 returns result.
* **Steps:**
  1. Provider priority chain: TVDB → TMDB → OMDb → AniList.
  2. Add `expires_at` field to `metadata/cache.py`; default TTL 12 h.
  3. Retry strategy: up to 3 attempts (0.5→4 s back-off) before fail-over.
  4. Mark provider unhealthy for run on repeated 5xx or quota errors.
  5. Purge cache lazily when `expires_at < now`.
* **Done when:** fallback and TTL tests green.

### 1.4 CLI TV Integration Happy Path
* **Goal:** `namegnome scan --media-type tv` on fixture tree exits 0 and emits valid plan JSON.
* **Tests to Write:** subprocess CLI integration test using tmpdir.
* **Steps:**
  1. Use test fixture library `tests/mocks/tv/...` as input.
  2. Run `namegnome scan --media-type tv --json -o plan.json` inside tmpdir.
  3. Parse `plan.json`, assert required keys (`items`, `root_dir`).
  4. Ensure exit code 0 and no stderr.
* **Done when:** integration test passes in CI.

### 1.5 Documentation Sweep
* **Goal:** Make sure that all documentation is robust and complete.
* **Steps:**)
  1. Review [README](README.md) for:
    A. Duplicate information.
    B. Incorrect legacy information (including flowcharts and diagrams).
    C. Incomplete or missing information or context.
    D. Formatting errors.
    E. Structure/flow inconsistency (make sure sections are grouped correctly and in an understandable progression).
  2. Review [/docs/](/docs/).
    A. Specifics:
      1. Delete KNOWN_ISSUES.md (this will be restored later when we've made more progress).
      2. Overhaul quickstart.md to be a better aid to first time users (this we'll retain for now, but we'll need to keep this current as we continue to add functionality).
      3. Does the project still have progress logging tools? If so, update progress-logging.md. Otherwise, delete progress-logging.md
* **Done when:** docs are polished and present the current state of the project.

### 1.6 Regression Test Suite — End-to-End TV Scan Flow
* **Goal:** Establish a rock-solid regression harness that exercises the *entire* TV scan pipeline (CLI + library) across real-world edge-case filenames, provider-failure scenarios, and LLM confidence paths.

* **Overall success criteria:**
  * Suite passes on macOS, Linux, and Windows runners.
  * Coverage for the scan pathway ≥ 85 %.
  * Runtime of happy-path test ≤ 5 s (network calls mocked).
  * Any change that breaks expected scan flow fails CI immediately.

* **Atomic sub-tasks:**

  | ID | Scope | Outcome |
  |----|-------|---------|
  | **1.6-a** | **Fixture manifest** | Add `fixture_manifest.yaml` enumerating every file in `tests/mocks/tv`, its `anthology` flag, and canonical season/episode mapping. Tests will read this manifest to build param cases automatically. |
  | **1.6-b** | **Deterministic LLM stub** | Implement `tests/helpers/fake_prompt_orchestrator.py` which replaces `PromptOrchestrator` with a configurable, no-network stub. Provide a pytest fixture `stub_llm` to toggle real vs fake. |
  | **1.6-c** | **Happy-path regression** | Write `tests/integration/test_tv_scan_regression.py::test_happy_path`. Using manifest + stub (confidence 0.90) expect exit 0; compare generated `plan.json` to `expected_plan.json`. Ensure wall-clock < 5 s. |
  | **1.6-d** | **Manual-required path** | Same fixture set; run stub confidence 0.50 → expect exit 2; assert items flagged `manual`. |
  | **1.6-e** | **Provider-fallback matrix** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Created `tests/integration/test_provider_fallback.py` with comprehensive fallback scenarios: (1) TVDB ok → exit 0/2; (2) TVDB failure → TMDB ok → exit 0/2; (3) TVDB + TMDB failure → OMDb ok → exit 0/2; (4) TVDB + TMDB + OMDb failure → AniList ok → exit 0/2; (5) all providers fail → items flagged manual → exit 1/2. Extended OMDb client to full MetadataClient. Added `ExitCode.UNSUPPORTED = 3` to CLI. All 6 tests pass. |
  | **1.6-f** | **Unsupported / malformed inputs** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Created `tests/mocks/tv/unsupported/` with 23 test files (ignored extensions, unknown extensions, malformed names). Implemented `tests/integration/test_unsupported_inputs.py` with 7 comprehensive tests. Updated fixture manifest with unsupported file entries. Files with media extensions but unparseable names are correctly marked as `manual` items requiring user intervention. All 7 integration tests pass. |
  | **1.6-g** | **Performance guard-rail** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Implemented `test_performance_guard_rail()` in `tests/integration/test_tv_scan_regression.py` that measures scan runtime and fails if it exceeds 5 seconds. Test passes in ~1.6s, well within the requirement. Guards against O(n²) behavior. |
  | **1.6-h** | **CI wiring** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Added fast `integration-tv` job to CI workflow (Linux, `--no-rich` flag), created nightly cross-platform matrix workflow, and updated coverage configuration to include integration tests with 85% threshold. CI now properly tests integration regression suite. |
  | **1.6-i** | **Documentation update** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Extended `SCAN_RULES.md` with confidence thresholds & exit-code semantics (section 4), added comprehensive "Regression Suite" section to README with local testing instructions, created `docs/fixture-manifest.md` documenting manifest format and structure. Documentation now covers all regression test aspects. |
  | **1.6-j** | **Untrusted-names span logic** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Harvey Girls Forever! fixtures already in manifest with `title_trusted: false`. Removed `@pytest.mark.xfail` from untrusted-titles tests, fixed duration-based episode pairing logic using `runtime` field, implemented SONARR-style handling ignoring input titles, confirmed punctuation replacement working correctly. Added integration test for Harvey Girls Forever using `--untrusted-titles` and `--max-duration` flags. All 4 untrusted-titles tests pass. |
  | **1.6-k** | **Complete regression coverage** | ✅ **COMPLETE** - Added comprehensive edge case testing for 100% SCAN_RULES.md compliance: (1) Show disambiguation with multi-series mock testing and non-interactive fallback behavior, (2) Absolute path enforcement validation (already working via typer resolve_path), (3) Duration edge cases testing with anthology mode and various max-duration scenarios, (4) Provider timeout/retry behavior with graceful fallback validation. All 4 new integration tests pass. Sprint 1.6 regression suite is now fully complete. |
  | **1.6-l** | **End-to-end testing with real APIs** | Implement true end-to-end tests using real TVDB/TMDB/OMDb APIs and real file operations, with optional LLM integration. Unlike regression tests that use mocks for deterministic results, these tests validate the complete pipeline works with actual external dependencies. Create `tests/e2e/test_real_tv_scan.py` with opt-in execution via `NAMEGNOME_E2E_TESTS=1` environment variable. Tests should: (1) Use real API keys from `.env` file, (2) **Gracefully handle LLM availability** - use real Ollama if available, fall back to deterministic responses if not, (3) Perform actual file operations in tmpdir, (4) Test complete scan→apply→undo cycle, (5) Validate perfect destination paths, (6) Handle series disambiguation gracefully, (7) Test visual CLI elements (banner, gnomes, progress). Include tests for: happy path with real Danger Mouse data, provider fallback with simulated failures, anthology handling with Paw Patrol, untrusted titles with Harvey Girls Forever. LLM-dependent tests marked with `@pytest.mark.llm` and skipped if Ollama unavailable. |

* **Tests to write (high level):**
  * `tests/integration/test_tv_scan_regression.py` – happy, manual, performance cases.
  * `tests/integration/test_provider_fallback.py` – provider matrix.
  * `tests/integration/test_unsupported_inputs.py` – malformed & unsupported files.
  * `tests/e2e/test_real_tv_scan.py` – end-to-end tests with real APIs and LLM.

* **Implementation notes:**
  1. **Manifest row format:**
     ```yaml
     - file: Paw Patrol/Paw Patrol-S01E01-Pups And The Kitty Tastrophe Pups Save A Train.mp4
       anthology: true
       season: 1
       episodes: [5, 6]
       status: auto
     ```
     For Harvey Girls Forever! and similar, add:
     ```yaml
     - file: Harvey Girls Forever/Harvey Girls Forever! - S01E01 - War and Trees WEBDL-1080p.mkv
       anthology: true
       title_trusted: false
       season: 1
       episodes: [1, 2]
       status: auto
     ```
  2. **Expected plan JSON** must include keys: `src`, `dst`, `status` (auto/manual/unsupported).
  3. **Confidence thresholds:** ≥ 0.75 → auto, 0.40–0.74 → manual, < 0.40 → unsupported.
  4. **Helper fixtures** should copy only required test files into a tmpdir for speed.
  5. **End-to-end test requirements:**
     - Opt-in execution: tests only run when `NAMEGNOME_E2E_TESTS=1` is set
     - Real API keys required: `.env` file with TVDB_API_KEY, TMDB_API_KEY, etc.
     - **LLM flexibility**: Tests detect Ollama availability and adapt accordingly:
       * If Ollama available: use real LLM responses for full E2E validation
       * If Ollama unavailable: fall back to deterministic responses (hybrid E2E)
       * LLM-dependent tests marked with `@pytest.mark.llm` and skipped gracefully
     - Test isolation: each test uses isolated tmpdir for file operations
     - Graceful failure: tests skip with clear message if dependencies unavailable
     - Performance validation: end-to-end scan should complete < 30s for real data
     - Complete cycle testing: scan → apply → undo → verify original state restored
     - CI compatibility: core E2E tests (API + file ops) can run without LLM dependency

* **Done when:**
  * All sub-tasks **1.6-a** → **1.6-l** are merged and green in CI.
  * Regression harness prevents future PRs from regressing TV scan behaviour.
  * End-to-end tests validate complete pipeline with real external dependencies.

## 5 · Sprint 4 (Apply Engine)

Purpose: safely execute rename plans with rollback.

### 4.1 `atomic_move` Implementation (see TASK 1.1 for spec)
* **Tests to Write:** same list as original TASK.md 1.1.
* **Steps:**
  1. POSIX: attempt `os.rename()`; if cross-device, stream copy to temp then replace.
  2. Windows: call `MoveFileExW` with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING | MOVEFILE_WRITE_THROUGH`.
  3. Add optional `--verify` flag to compare SHA-256 checksums pre/post move.
  4. Write rollback journal (JSONL) and restore on failure.
* **Done when:** all FS op tests pass.

  2. If `--dry-run`, print rich diff table, exit 0.
  3. Wrap execution in `ConsoleManager`; update progress per file.
  4. On exception or SIGINT, trigger rollback via journal.
* **Done when:** command works & tests pass.

### 4.3 Plan Store Housekeeping
* **Goal:** Provide CLI & library utilities to prune and query stored plans (delete all, keep-last-N, cap per directory, fetch latest plan ID / print latest plan).
* **Tests to Write:**
  * `tests/utils/test_plan_store_housekeeping.py` covering:
    * `delete_all_plans()` removes all JSON & meta files.
    * `delete_all_but_latest(n)` keeps latest *n* by timestamp.
    * `get_latest_plan_id_by_root(path)` returns newest plan generated for that root dir.
    * `print_latest_plan(path)` pretty-prints plan table to console.
    * Retention cap: saving the 11th plan for same root auto-deletes oldest so only 10 remain.
* **Steps:**
  1. Extend `utils.plan_store` with:
     ```python
     def delete_plans(keep_last: int | None = None) -> int
     def get_latest_plan_id_by_root(root: Path) -> str | None
     def print_latest_plan(root: Path, console: Console | None = None) -> None
     ```
  2. Record `root_dir` in `RunMetadata.args` when saving plans (already present as `scan_options.root_dir` – expose helper to filter).
  3. Add Typer sub-command group `plan` with:
     * `plan list`  – list stored plan IDs with timestamp & root.
     * `plan prune --keep N` – delete all but last *N* plans globally or per-root (`--root PATH`).
     * `plan latest --root PATH` – print latest ID.
     * `plan show --root PATH` – pretty-print latest plan diff.
  4. Enforce automatic cap of 10 plans per root in `save_plan()`; when exceeded, delete oldest plan+meta.
  5. Update docs (`README`, `DEMO.md`) to reference new commands and retention policy.
* **Done when:**
  * All housekeeping tests pass, including automatic cap.
  * New CLI commands work in integration test and docs.
  * `save_plan()` auto-prunes to ≤10 plans per root.

### 4.4 Documentation Sweep

      1. Delete KNOWN_ISSUES.md (this will be restored later when we've made more progress).
      2. Overhaul quickstart.md to be a better aid to first time users (this we'll retain for now, but we'll need to keep this current as we continue to add functionality).
      3. Does the project still have progress logging tools? If so, update progress-logging.md. Otherwise, delete progress-logging.md
* **Done when:** docs are polished and present the current state of the project.

## 7 · Sprint 6 (GUI Tech Spike)

Purpose: evaluate frameworks and ship minimal viewer prototype.

### 6.1 Framework Selection Spike
* **Goal:** produce comparison doc (Textual vs Toga vs Electron vs Web) with PoC branch.
* **Tests:** N/A – spike, time-boxed.
* **Steps:**
  1. Create matrix comparing dev experience, cross-platform support, bundle size, theming.
  2. Prototype "Hello-world" in top two contenders; record build instructions.
  3. Document decision in `docs/gui-framework-decision.md`.
* **Done when:** decision documented & PoC archived.

### 6.2 Minimal Scan Viewer
* **Goal:** list scan plans and allow approve/apply.
* **Tests:** e2e Playwright happy path clicking approve triggers `apply` API call (mocked).
* **Steps:**
  1. Backend: lightweight FastAPI exposing `/plans`, `/apply/{id}`; bind to 127.0.0.1 with token auth.
  2. Front-end: Textual-web app fetches `/plans` via WebSocket, renders table, shows approve button.
  3. SSE stream `/apply/{id}/progress` updates progress bar.
* **Done when:** viewer PoC demo recorded.

### 6.3 Documentation Sweep
* **Goal:** Make sure that all documentation is robust and complete.
* **Steps:**)
  1. Review [README](README.md) for:
    A. Duplicate information.
    B. Incorrect legacy information (including flowcharts and diagrams).
    C. Incomplete or missing information or context.
    D. Formatting errors.
    E. Structure/flow inconsistency (make sure sections are grouped correctly and in an understandable progression).
  2. Review [/docs/](/docs/).
    A. Specifics:
      1. Delete KNOWN_ISSUES.md (this will be restored later when we've made more progress).
      2. Overhaul quickstart.md to be a better aid to first time users (this we'll retain for now, but we'll need to keep this current as we continue to add functionality).
      3. Does the project still have progress logging tools? If so, update progress-logging.md. Otherwise, delete progress-logging.md
* **Done when:** docs are polished and present the current state of the project.

## 8 · Cross-Cutting Epics (Ongoing)

* **Provider Rate-Limit Handling** – retry with exponential backoff; shared util tests.
* **Windows Path Edge-Cases** – path length, reserved names; targeted tests.
* **Performance Profiling** – 10k file library benchmark, create ticket if >30 s.
* **Security & Dependency Audit** – monthly Dependabot review.
