"""Extra tests to exercise the diverse parsing branches in
*namegnome.llm.prompt_orchestrator*.

These inputs simulate the variety of formats an LLM might return when asked to
select episode titles from a list.  They ensure the private helper
`_parse_llm_disambiguate_response` can gracefully handle each format and that
all specialised case-functions are executed at least once.
