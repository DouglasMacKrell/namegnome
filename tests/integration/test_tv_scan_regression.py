"""Integration tests for TV scan regression - Sprint 1.6-c.

This module provides end-to-end CLI integration tests that exercise the entire
TV scan pipeline using real fixture files and deterministic LLM responses.

The tests validate:
- Exit code 0 for successful scans
- Valid plan.json structure with required keys
- Performance requirements (< 5 seconds wall-clock time)
- Consistent behavior across different confidence levels

Uses the fixture manifest from Sprint 1.6-a and deterministic LLM stub from
Sprint 1.6-b to ensure reproducible test results.
