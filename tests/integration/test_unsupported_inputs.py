"""Integration tests for unsupported and malformed inputs - Sprint 1.6-f.

This module provides integration tests that verify the system correctly handles
unsupported file types and malformed filenames by properly classifying them
as unsupported and ensuring they don't break the scan/plan pipeline.

The tests validate:
- Files with ignored extensions (nfo, srt, txt, jpg, etc.) are skipped entirely
- Files with unknown extensions are classified as unsupported
- Files with malformed names that can't be parsed are handled gracefully
- Mixed scenarios with supported and unsupported files work correctly
- CLI exits with appropriate codes when encountering unsupported files

Uses the test fixtures in tests/mocks/tv/unsupported/ which contain various
categories of unsupported files for comprehensive testing.
