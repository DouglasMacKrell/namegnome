"""Command-line interface for namegnome.

This package provides the Typer app and global console for all CLI commands and
user-facing output.

- app: The Typer application object, used by all CLI entrypoints and subcommands.
- console: Rich Console instance for consistent, styled output and logging.
- All CLI modules import app and console from this package to use rich for output,
  show pretty tracebacks, and provide a single CLI entrypoint for all commands.

Follows CLI UX guidelines from PLANNING.md: always use rich for output, show
pretty tracebacks, and provide a single CLI entrypoint for all commands.
