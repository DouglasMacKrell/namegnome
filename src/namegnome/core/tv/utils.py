    Each output dict contains *integer* ``season`` and ``episode`` keys plus a

    1. Zero-padded strings are coerced to ``int`` (``"07" -> 7``).
    2. Rows with non-numeric season/episode, negatives, or zeros are **dropped**
       (specials like *S00E00* are handled elsewhere).
    3. Titles are passed through unchanged – sanitising is caller-side.

    These guarantees simplify downstream TV planners by ensuring they never
